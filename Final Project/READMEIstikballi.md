## Background

Broadcast also plays an important role as a medium of information and communication in information traffic that forms knowledge through human input media in the form of eyes and ears (audio and visual).
This information traffic causes spontaneous and long-term acceptance through the intelligence possessed by humans assisted by innovation to form a knowledge that forms the basis for the creation of an intelligent society.
Knowledge dissemination increases awareness in the underlying community system not only knowing but also understanding and being able to classify all kinds of right and wrong forms of actions, responses and prospects.
This is also based on the high level of [human resources of productive age in Indonesia](2.	https://www.neliti.com/id/publications/38808/model-peningkatan-kualitas-sdm-penduduk-usia-kerja-yang-unggul-professional-dan), which makes the potential to educate the nation's life a necessity.

In addition, in welcoming the industrial revolution of society 5.0, information technology, communication and productive young human resources also play an important role in [realizing developments both in Indonesia and on the world stage.](4.	https://puslitjakdikbud.kemdikbud.go.id/produk/artikel/detail/3133/gen-z-dominan-apa-maknanya-bagi-pendidikan-kita)
And the demographic bonus also goes hand in hand when this beloved republic wants to reach the age of one century.
Therefore, these facilities are the benchmarks and factors in realizing our potential and plans in 2045, namely, [“One century of Indonesia: sovereign, advanced, just and prosperous.](5.	https://www.bappenas.go.id/files/Visi%20Indonesia%202045/Ringkasan%20Eksekutif%20Visi%20Indonesia%202045_Final.pdf)

Along with the industrial revolution 4.0 based on artificial intelligence technology, everything that includes daily needs must be immediately synchronized online.
The basis of the online world is the processing of data derived from information analysis. So do not be surprised if all kinds of social activities are based on data such as school management, work, daily data collection to curriculum vitae.
From these problems, I want to develop an innovation to answer and develop things needed to support future technologies based on programming and artificial intelligence.

## Problems

But of all these factors we have a few problems that cannot be solved personally.
This problem is divided into two: from the speaker factor (provider of information) and also the audience (receiver of information).

The first factor occurs for many things, including the biggest one is the facilities and packaging of Indonesian broadcast media which are still inadequate.
The closest example in everyday life, sometimes we like to complain about bad connections when we [do virtual learning which hinders the receipt of information](6.	https://id.cips-indonesia.org/post/ringkasan-kebijakan-mengkaji-hambatan-pembelajaran-jarak-jauh-di-indonesia-di-masa-covid-19-3)
Then social media, websites, television which are under the auspices of the government are considered less attractive and less educating many parties.
Also, the contribution of productive human resources, especially Generation Z, who became the [main face of a century of Indonesia, is still considered very lacking.](7.	https://kominfo.go.id/content/detail/1926/informasi-edukatif-pada-tv-indonesia-masih-kurang/0/sorotan_media)
This is due to the lack of equitable distribution of mindset and awareness of these people.
There are a small number of them who have the potential to develop Indonesian broadcasting, as we can see from the executive heads of well-known Indonesian universities in carrying out consolidation maneuvers when conveying their aspirations to the government.
Only they have the disadvantage of wanting to show their intellectual capacity more than conveying information to the general public.
So that their ability is considered less able to reach the flow of society.
Not only that, most of the media in Indonesia are more concerned with high-informed content than how to make the information well received by the public.

Then the second factor occurs from [the intellectual side and awareness of our society which is still very lacking.](8.	https://tirto.id/indeks-pendidikan-indonesia-rendah-daya-saing-pun-lemah-dnvR)
So that causes a few problems starting from the reluctance to get or receive correct information so that gossip can freely mill about.
Then the lack of public awareness that makes it difficult for them to receive information.
Then there was a misunderstanding between one another. It doesn't stop there, when we find people with high arrogance, they will provoke and spread hoax news from the results of these misunderstandings.
This is inseparable from the fact that our society is very diverse. This is a challenge in itself how we can distribute information even though there are very significant differences in awareness in social classes.

From these problems, we try to develop a platform that will later be the solution that will be the end of the chain of eradicating the problem.
To create a social media and communication platform, data and information that is healthy, it is necessary to form an integrated and one-roof platform so that it is affordable by all people.

## Analysis

The productive age, especially Generation Z, must work together in developing an ideal broadcasting system for all levels of society.
This can be started from raising awareness of young people and also all human resources who contribute in broadcasting agencies to further improve the quality of informative and interactive content while maintaining idealism so that it can be accepted by all levels of society.
It should also be noted that putting aside one's ego and agency is an important thing. Because as long as the ego is still found, there is a gap between the giver and the recipient of information that makes the distribution of information fail.
Also with the development of technology and to realize the industrial revolution of society 5.0, the use of social media is important because it is the [main milestone of broadcasting in the 21th century.](8.	https://tirto.id/indeks-pendidikan-indonesia-rendah-daya-saing-pun-lemah-dnvR)
Such as creating Instagram, Tiktok, Youtube content with the theme of national awareness packaged in unique short videos, plus more interaction. between content creators and viewers with QnA and giveaway is a small example that has a big impact on broadcasting development.

Then the government can raise public awareness by drafting laws that help socialize the importance of raising awareness in society. Because actually all information in this world has been created by God in abundance.
Only selfishness in humans makes this awareness closed and stagnant which causes no observation and innovation to form new knowledge. This awareness is also the answer to the challenges of the various layers of our society that make it difficult for information traffic.
With this, there is an even distribution of awareness that becomes a bridge between groups that facilitates the flow of information in and out. This can be helped by the workforce of young people, bureaucracy and the potential of broadcast media that we have.
Of course, all of this cannot be separated from the role of the government to provide special funds for the development of Indonesian broadcasting as the initial milestone of education which is the basis for advanced Indonesia.

## Idea

Istikballi is a data platform that provides every curriculum vitae and all kinds of records of a person.
Istikballi is taken from the Ottoman Turkish word which means Future People.
In summary, this platform is a combination of social media and website features that have been developed in general.
We took the feature of viewing resumes and the ability to make it easier to find work or favorite schools/universities such as features developed by LinkedIn.

Then there are also self-development features through written, visual, audio, and audiovisual content such as Youtube, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Blogs, and so on.
Not only that but this feature can also be used to passively communicate to the public with the content produced.

Then there are self-introduction and communication features such as WhatsApp, Telegram and so on which are still in the development stage.

And lastly, this feature can be used specifically by agencies that have the authority to hold data such as the E-Devlet website in the Republic of Turkey which accommodates all kinds of citizen data to facilitate integration and regulation when they want to take care of a document or when there are problems in administrative matters.

<p>I am a person who really likes to share with others, especially knowledge and information. After I succeeded in obtaining or making new knowledge and information I immediately shared it with others. With this knowledge I succeeded in influencing and getting the influence of others through what social media platforms support the dissemination of my information. So as to create a charismatic leadership.</p>

<p>I am a person who is good at management, especially business. I have started my business since the age of eleven with investing in gold. Then I also started a small business by selling snacks at my school. Now my business customers have become international standards and the profit from my investment has reached more than 2000 dollars.</p>

Of course, this feature is also still in the development stage which will later create this platform as the most integrated social media that can be used by all state governments to connect communication and information between the people with people and the people with government.
With this platform, social media is also easier to reach and simpler because there are already several features that make it one platform for all.
Compared to us now who have various kinds of social media which are quite troublesome, especially in data synchronization and other things.

## What do i get from cs50x?

I gained new skills in developing artificial intelligence to process data automatically which will be developed later this platform.
Later I also gained skills in developing crypto technologies to improve data security and reduce data abuse on the platform.
I also learned how to design a website so that the website looks beautiful and unique that can attract the attention of the wider people.
Considering that the public is also less interested in a platform that has an ordinary design even though it has many features.
It should also be remembered that art is the most important thing besides technology and knowledge to develop everything.
Without these three things will not be able to develop and eventually die. And lastly and most importantly, I must have an idea to base this platform on.
And I got the idea from studying sociology, psychology, communication science, and informatics.

## Aim

With the plan that I have made, I am sure that the innovation that I develop today will be one of the best innovations.
For now, I'm more likely to say it's not yet good enough considering there are still some features I need to develop.
But with today's error, there will be evaluation and correction that will give birth to an innovation that becomes the main fuel in the development of technology.

## Conclusion

The cooperation of all agencies and cooperation between the community and the government is important to [solve problems and realize the plans of the solutions that have been designed.](9.	https://balitbang.pemkomedan.go.id/tinymcpuk/gambar/file/YOHANNA%20100901026.pdf)
Release of ego, compromise and communication become the main bridge between the layers of society and the government, also helps in achieving equality and common goals in creating an orderly social system.
Then after the good information traffic, slowly every soul of the Indonesian people will be educated. Smart society is the key to a great nation and a great country.
